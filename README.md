# LearnWild

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0. It was inspired by a lot of different existing github resources and frameworks:
1. For the basic dynamic instantiation of components, thanks to this project: https://github.com/manfredsteyer/dynamic-dashboard-sample-angular2
2. For the masonry implementation in Angular2, thanks for this project: https://github.com/jelgblad/angular2-masonry-demo

This project relies on the following frameworks / libraries:
1. Angular (https://angular.io");
2. Angular Material (https://material.angular.io/);
3. Angular CLI (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli);
4. Masonry (http://masonry.desandro.com/);
5. RSS2Json (https://rss2json.com);

Since I read many blogs and rss feeds as well as listen to many podcasts, I just wanted a centralized place where I could add new sources of information easily. It is similar to a central repository of API calls to various public sources of information. I am hoping to make it available to anyone so that users can build they own dynamic dashboard. I also welcome any feedback from the community for ideas, comments, fixes and improvements to the code base. 

I am just starting with very basic functionality to read remote rss feeds and planning to expand the type of "cards" to:
1. twitter feeds;
2. podcast feeds with the ability to play them directly in the dashboard;
3. video feeds with the ability to play them directly in the the dashboard;
4. consume the google+ API;
5. consume the NYT API for news and cooking recipes;
6. add the ability to categorize "cards" and filter accordingly;
7. add the ability to filter "cards" by type: twitter, google+, pinterest... and NOT facebook!

That's it. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
